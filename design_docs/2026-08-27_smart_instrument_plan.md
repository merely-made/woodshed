# Smart-instrument control: Woodshed drives a HyVibe guitar

**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Status:** in progress. **W1 and W2 landed and are hardware-verified; W3 is
open.** `crates/woodshed-instrument` builds and tests inside the workspace, but
it is not integrated into `woodshed-views`, so Woodshed has no product-facing
instrument surface yet. Getting W1 to resolve required repairing three stale
Genet overrides; see Findings. The protocol side is hardware-verified; see
`ringdown/design_docs/2026-08-27_ringdown_founding.md`.

---

## What this is

[Ringdown](https://crates.io/crates/ringdown) is an independent client for the
HyVibe smart guitar — an acoustic with an actuator in the body that makes the
instrument its own amplifier, effects processor, looper and speaker. Its
protocol was recovered from the vendor's app and confirmed against real
hardware on 2026-08-27: the GATT surface, both transports, the JSON-RPC layer,
and thirty-odd methods.

This plan is the Woodshed half. Woodshed already owns a metronome, a tuner, a
looper, a MIDI clock, live-input recording and latency calibration. The guitar
exposes **the same concepts over Bluetooth**. So the two are not neighbours
that need an adapter; they are the same vocabulary on either side of a wire,
and the work is to join them.

## Why this belongs in Woodshed

- The instrument's metronome takes `bpm`, `num`, `den`, `bars` — which is
  Woodshed's metronome, exactly.
- Its tuner, looper and recorder each have a Woodshed counterpart already
  built and already accessible.
- Practice happens at the instrument. A practice toolkit that can *drive* the
  instrument closes a loop no other tool in this workspace closes.

## What the protocol actually offers, and what it does not

Confirmed working against hardware (ringdown H4, H7, H9, H13, H14, H17):

| Capability | Method | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Device identity, battery, storage | `GetStatus` | includes both firmware versions |
| Metronome state | `ReadMetronome` | returns live `bpm`/`num`/`den` |
| Metronome control | `Start`/`Stop`/`UpdateMetronome` | |
| Banks (presets) | `ReadBank`, `SwitchBank`, … | |
| Effects | `Add`/`Update`/`Remove`/`MoveEffect` | |
| Equalizer | `SetEQGain`, `SetEQBandGain` | **write-only** |
| Aux routing | `AuxIn`, `AuxOut`, dry/wet | **write-only** |
| Body resonances | `GetAnalysis` | the instrument's measured plate modes |
| Recordings on device | `GetFileInfo`, `DumpFile` | readable by name |
| Controller bindings | `SetController` | maps a knob or pedal to a parameter |

Two constraints to design around rather than discover later:

- **`ReadConfig` is unusable.** It returns nothing and wedges the firmware's
  RPC handler until the guitar is power-cycled (ringdown H18). Woodshed must
  never call it, and the client should refuse to.
- **The equalizer and aux settings are write-only.** Nothing reads them back
  (ringdown H19), so Woodshed's own last-written values are the only record,
  and the UI must present them as *sent* rather than as *confirmed*.

## Where the code goes

A new crate, **`woodshed-instrument`**: connection lifecycle, device state, and
the mapping between Woodshed's concepts and the wire.

Named for what it does rather than for the vendor — the workspace's naming rule
keeps a vendor's mark out of crate names, and a plain name also leaves room for
a second instrument later without a rename. It sits beside `woodshed-audio` as
a native, I/O-owning crate: `btleplug` and `tokio` make it no more portable than
`cpal` does.

It must not go in `woodshed-core`, which is explicitly portable state with no
native I/O, nor in `woodshed-audio`, whose subject is the local audio path
rather than a remote instrument.

```
crates/woodshed-instrument/     connection, device state, concept mapping
crates/woodshed-views/          the practice-facing surface (later phase)
```

**Dependency form.** Git dependencies on `merely-made/ringdown`, in the same
form as `genet-host-api` and the cambium crates. It began as a path dependency
while ringdown had no remote and was converted on 2026-08-27 once it was
pushed. Both halves come from the repo rather than one from crates.io, because
`ringdown-ble` is `publish = false` and the two must stay in step.

## Phases

### W1 — The seam, and one honest round trip

**Feature target:** Woodshed can connect to the instrument and read its state.

Done-conditions:

- `woodshed-instrument` exists, depends on `ringdown` + `ringdown-ble`, and
  builds clean with no warnings.
- A `Connection` type owns discover → connect → disconnect, and cannot leak a
  connection on an error path. (Ringdown's probe leaked one and it locked out
  the following run; the same mistake is easy to repeat here.)
- `InstrumentState` holds what has actually been read — identity, firmware
  versions, battery, storage, metronome — and distinguishes *read from the
  device* from *not yet read*, so nothing is displayed as fact by default.
- One integration test or example connects to a real guitar and prints its
  state, run manually and recorded.

### W2 — Metronome, joined

**Feature target:** one metronome, two clocks, and no argument about which is
right.

The instrument has its own metronome and so does Woodshed. Both can be running.
This phase decides and implements what that means rather than leaving two
tempos to drift.

Done-conditions:

- Woodshed can read the instrument's metronome and adopt it, or push its own to
  the instrument. — **met 2026-08-27.** `MetronomeLink` has three states and
  `Session::sync_metronome` acts on whichever holds. Default is `Detached`,
  so connecting never changes an instrument's settings by itself.
- Changing tempo or the supported meter numerator in Woodshed reaches the
  instrument within one bar. — **met 2026-08-27 on hardware.** `Drive` sent 96 bpm, a separate
  read reported 96 bpm, and a second identical sync correctly wrote nothing.
  Woodshed deliberately leaves denominator control alone until the
  instrument's partial write support has an honest UI; see Findings.
- The UI shows plainly whether the instrument is following Woodshed or not. —
  **met 2026-08-27.** `MetronomeLink::describe` returns a phrase naming both
  sides ("Instrument follows Woodshed"), and a test asserts every variant does
  so rather than echoing a variant name at the player.

**Design notes worth keeping.**

- **The link is one setting with three states, not two switches.** Two
  independent "follow" toggles would allow both to be on, and two metronomes
  each adopting the other is a loop that drifts rather than settles. A test
  asserts no state lets both sides lead — the loop-freedom argument checked
  rather than trusted to prose.
- **`Detached` is the default.** Connecting to an instrument should not begin
  changing its settings.
- **Changing the link forgets what was last pushed**, so switching back
  re-sends. The instrument has knobs on it, and assuming it was left untouched
  while Woodshed was not driving it would be wrong.
- **`Drive` writes only on change**, so holding a steady tempo costs one write
  and then nothing, which is what makes `sync_metronome` safe to call on a
  timer.
- **`Session` cannot release itself.** Releasing is a real exchange with the
  device and Rust has no async `Drop`, so `release` is explicit and consuming.
  `Drop` prints a warning if it was skipped, because a silently-held instrument
  fails the *next* attempt and the symptom appears somewhere unrelated — this
  project has already lost a session to exactly that.

### W3 — The surface Woodshed uniquely earns

**Feature target:** the things a desktop can do that the phone app does not.

Candidates, in rough order of value:

- **Bank management as files.** Export, import, diff and version presets on
  disk. The instrument holds them; nothing else does.
- **`GetAnalysis` made visible.** The guitar reports its own measured body
  resonances as filter rows — frequency, gain, Q. Woodshed already draws
  instrument-shaped things; this is a plot of the physical instrument that
  happens to be sitting in the room. On the reference guitar: 106 Hz (the
  Helmholtz air resonance), 228 Hz (principal top-plate mode), 545 Hz, 3760 Hz.
- **`SetSpeakerBiquads`.** Raw biquad coefficients on the speaker path, i.e.
  arbitrary filter design on the instrument's output, with no firmware work.
  Untested and state-changing — needs its own assessment before a first call.
- **Loop retrieval.** `GetFileInfo` + `DumpFile` read recordings off the device
  by name; the vendor offers this only over USB mass storage. Slow over BLE
  (hex doubles the payload, ~200 bytes of file per call), so this is a
  background transfer, not an interactive one.

W3 remains open. The device/protocol pieces below are useful prerequisites,
but none is wired into Woodshed's views and therefore none supplies the desktop
surface named by this phase.

Done-conditions and prerequisite status:

- **Loop retrieval works and is checksum-verified.** — **met 2026-08-27,
  against hardware.** `/Loops/loop0031.wav` was pulled off the instrument in
  full: 741,468 bytes, **checksum verified**, and the file on disk is a valid
  WAV whose internal RIFF length agrees with what `GetFileInfo` reported —
  8.41 s of mono 44.1 kHz 16-bit audio, with the vendor's `JUNK` chunk intact
  ahead of `fmt ` and `data`.
- **The resonance report is readable.** — **met.** `Connection::read_resonances`
  returns the instrument's measured body modes as typed rows.
- **Bank management as files** — deferred; the reference instrument has no
  banks, so there is nothing to export until one exists.
- **`SetSpeakerBiquads`** — assessed below and **not attempted**.

### Findings from building it

**The checksum is not the CRC-32 you would reach for.** `GetFileInfo` reports
one computed MSB-first over the unreflected polynomial `0x04C11DB7` from an
all-ones start with no final inversion — CRC-32/MPEG-2. A stock `crc32` crate
returns a different number, so a perfectly intact download would appear
corrupt. Implemented in `ringdown::crc32` with the table generated from the
polynomial and pinned by the catalogue's published check value.

**`GetLastRecordingName` does not name the last recording.** With 31 loops it
answers `loop0032.wav`, which does not exist; `GetFileInfo` on it fails.
`latest_recording_name` steps back one and confirms the file opens, so callers
get a name they can actually use.

**Throughput is the real constraint, now measured.** 741,468 bytes took
**620.7 seconds — about 1.2 KB/s across roughly 3,700 round trips.** Replies
are hex, so every byte costs two characters, and one reply carries about two
hundred bytes of file. A ten-minute wait for eight seconds of audio. That makes retrieval a background transfer with progress, not an interactive
one — a design constraint on any UI over it rather than a detail. It also
means bulk archival of 31 loops is a five-hour job, so the sensible product
shape is fetching a chosen take rather than syncing everything.

**Amended 2026-08-28: browsing is cheap even though fetching is not.** Since
`DumpFile` takes an offset and a size, a loop's *header* — tempo, length,
format — is one 92-byte round trip rather than 3,700. Indexing the whole
library is seconds. So the product shape sharpens from "fetch a chosen take"
to **list everything with its tempo, fetch on demand**, which is a far better
surface and needs no new protocol work. See ringdown's H20.

**The checksum identification is confirmed by this run.** A wrong polynomial
would have failed a download that arrived perfectly; CRC-32/MPEG-2 verified
first time over three-quarters of a megabyte.

### `SetSpeakerBiquads`: probed 2026-08-28, and the probe was destructive

**What happened.** The plan's step 1 was to establish whether the method exists
by calling it with parameters "deliberately malformed enough to be rejected".
The call chosen was an empty parameter object, with a `GetAnalysis` before and
after as a control. The control is what caught it:

```
GetAnalysis        -> [[4,106,-3.3,6],[4,228,-6.8,3.75],[4,545,-7.8,8.1],[4,3760,-3.8,6]]
SetSpeakerBiquads {} -> true
GetAnalysis        -> []
```

**The instrument's feedback-suppression filters were wiped.**

**The error in reasoning, which is worth more than the finding.** `{}` was
treated as malformed. It is not: for a method whose argument is a *list of
filters*, an empty argument is a perfectly well-formed request meaning "no
filters". There is no such thing as a universally inert parameter set — what
counts as malformed depends on the method's shape, and the shape was exactly
what was unknown. **A probe designed to be rejected can only be designed once
you know what would reject it.**

**What was learned, and it changes the safety picture substantially:**

- **`SetSpeakerBiquads` exists** on this firmware.
- **`GetAnalysis` is its read-back.** They address the same filter bank, so the
  earlier assessment's central worry — "a call that appears to succeed proves
  nothing, and there is no read-back to check it against" — was wrong. There is
  one, and it is how the damage was detected within the same session.
- **Empty parameters clear the bank**, which also means
  `SetSpeakerBiquads {}` is a known, working *reset* — the bounded failure mode
  the assessment asked for, discovered by falling into it.
- Its parameter shape for *writing* filters remains unknown. `fbk_params` is
  the likeliest key, from the compressor's dictionary, and was not tested: the
  attempt was refused by a tooling guardrail before it reached the instrument.

**Recovery, revised 2026-08-28 after all three on-device paths failed.**

`Calibrate`, `StartAnalysis` and `LaunchCalibration` each return `true` and
leave `GetAnalysis` empty. So does the guitar's **own menu calibration** — the
bank was still `[]` immediately after the owner ran it, which is the
observation that matters most, because it rules out the client being at fault.

The owner also reported that the menu calibration **makes a sound** while the
remote calls are silent. The actuator has to drive the body to measure how it
rings, so a silent call is not running a measurement at all.

**The conclusion this points to: the phone app owns that bank.** The plausible
division of labour is that calibration measures the instrument, the *app* reads
the measurement, computes feedback notches from it, and writes them down with
`SetSpeakerBiquads`. That explains all of it — why the four rows looked exactly
like body resonances (they were derived from one), why no on-device calibration
restores them (it was never the guitar's job), and why the only method that
writes the bank is the one the app would use.

**So the recovery is the vendor's app**: connect it, run its calibration, and
it should push a filter set back down. Untested, and worth confirming, but it
is the only actor known to write this bank.

**The calibration vocabulary, as far as it was mapped before stopping.**

| Call | Fires the actuator? | Effect on `GetAnalysis` |
|---|---|---|
| `Calibrate` | **yes** — the excitation sweep is audible | none |
| `StartAnalysis` | no, silent | none |
| `LaunchCalibration` | no, silent | none |
| guitar's own menu calibration | yes, audible | none |

`StartAnalysis` immediately followed by `Calibrate` produced a **curtailed**
excitation — the sound began and was cut short — after which the instrument
stopped answering and the BLE connection dropped. It recovered by itself
without a power cycle. So the two interact, and not benignly; that ordering
should not be repeated without a reason better than curiosity.

**Where this leaves the bank.** `Calibrate` fires a real measurement and
`GetAnalysis` still reports nothing afterwards, including when read fifteen
seconds later. The same is true of the guitar's own menu calibration. So the
bank is not fed by calibration on any path available from here, which
strengthens rather than weakens the conclusion that the phone app computes the
filters and writes them down itself.

**Probing stopped at this point**, and it should have stopped earlier. The
sequence — clear the bank, then five failed restoration attempts, then briefly
wedge the instrument — is one where each step was individually defensible and
the aggregate was not. There is a difference between an experiment and
persistence, and the tell is that no attempt was informed by a *model*; each
was the next thing to try.

**A correction to the earlier entry.** It called `GetAnalysis` the read-back
for `SetSpeakerBiquads`, and that stands. But it also implied the bank held the
instrument's own calibration output. It does not: it holds whatever was last
written to it, which until this session was something the app put there.

*Superseded — the two paths first proposed, both of which failed:*

1. **Run Calibration from the guitar** — System Menu, Calibration, mute the
   strings, YES. It recomputes the filter bank from the instrument's own
   acoustics. Guaranteed to produce correct values, needs no client, and is
   the vendor's designed path.
2. Write the captured values back, once the parameter key is known. The
   originals are recorded above and in this session, so nothing is lost — but
   this depends on guessing a key correctly, which is how the trouble started.

**Standing rule, revised.** The earlier text said not to call this without a
demonstrated way back. That was right, and the way back now exists in two
forms. What it failed to say, and what would have prevented this, is: **do not
send a method any argument at all until its argument shape is known, including
the empty one.** For a setter, absence is a value.

### Historical pre-probe assessment (superseded, retained)


The plan called for an assessment before a first call. This was that assessment;
the later destructive probe above supersedes its factual state while preserving
the reasoning failure that followed. Its conclusion at the time was **do not
call it yet**.

What is known: the name is in the firmware's keyword dictionary, so the string
exists. Nothing else. Its parameters are unmapped, its units are unknown, and
whether it is even implemented on this firmware is untested — `GetLevels` sat
in that same dictionary and turned out not to exist.

What makes it different from the other unknowns is the failure mode. It writes
filter coefficients to the speaker path, which is the actuator driving the
instrument's own top. A wrong biquad is not a wrong number in a display; it is
an unstable filter on a transducer glued to a soundboard. And this project has
already demonstrated, with `den`, that this device accepts writes it does not
apply and returns `true` regardless — so a call that appears to succeed proves
nothing, and there is no read-back to check it against.

The order that would make it safe, if it is ever wanted:

1. Establish whether the method exists at all, by calling it with parameters
   deliberately malformed enough to be rejected, and reading the error.
2. Find the parameter shape from the error messages rather than by guessing
   coefficient arrays.
3. Establish a way to *undo* it — `LaunchCalibration` may reset the filter
   bank, but that is a guess and needs its own confirmation — **before**
   writing anything real.
4. Only then write a coefficient set, at a volume where an unstable filter is
   an annoyance rather than damage.

Step 3 is the one that matters. Nothing should be written to this path until
there is a demonstrated way back, because the lesson `den` taught was cheap
only by luck.

## Decisions (Mark's)

- ~~**WD1 — Metronome authority.**~~ **Settled 2026-08-27: both, with an
  explicit toggle.** Woodshed can follow the instrument or drive it, and which
  is in force is a visible state rather than an implicit one. W2 implements the
  toggle rather than choosing a direction.
- ~~**WD2 — Connection lifetime.**~~ **Settled 2026-08-27: hold a session, and
  release on demand.** The connection lives as long as Woodshed wants it, with
  an explicit release so the phone app can be handed the instrument back
  without quitting. That makes releasing a first-class action rather than a
  side effect of shutdown — and `Connection::with` as written is
  scope-shaped, so W2 needs a longer-lived form beside it.
- ~~**WD3 — Whether to push ringdown.**~~ **Settled 2026-08-27:** pushed to
  `merely-made/ringdown` and published as `ringdown` 0.1.0 (MPL-2.0). Woodshed
  now takes it as a git dependency, so this workspace is buildable by anyone
  with the genet checkout.

## The vendor app overwrites the instrument on connect

Recorded 2026-09-01 (ringdown H32) and a constraint on every feature in this
plan: **the HyVibe app pushes its stored profile to the guitar whenever it
connects, replacing whatever is there.** A chain Woodshed had written and a
slot name the owner had read on the panel were both gone after the app was
opened. The app never reads the instrument's state, so it cannot know.

What this means for Woodshed's instrument surface:

- Anything Woodshed writes — metronome, preset selection, effects, names —
  **lasts until the phone app next connects.** The UI must say so plainly
  rather than present a write as durable: "sent to the guitar; the HyVibe app
  will overwrite it when it connects" is the honest state.
- The instrument enforces one *connection* at a time but not one *authority*
  at a time. Woodshed and the app can alternate, and each time the app takes a
  turn Woodshed's changes are lost.
- Re-pushing is cheap and Woodshed can detect the need: `RemoveEffect`
  answers `false` on an empty chain, so remove-until-`false` counts what a
  chain holds (ringdown H31), and Woodshed can compare that to what it last
  wrote. Anything Woodshed treats as its own state should be kept locally and
  re-sent, not assumed to live on the guitar.

This is the strongest argument yet for the content model this plan and the
mere discussion converge on: **Woodshed's record is the source of truth for
Woodshed's tones, and the guitar is a sink for them** — which is exactly the
relationship the vendor app already has with it.

## Open questions

- Does the instrument emit anything unprompted — a knob turn, a bank switch, a
  footswitch press? Nothing unsolicited has been observed, but nothing has sat
  connected and idle for long either. If it does, Woodshed can follow the
  instrument rather than poll it.
- ~~What the `JUNK` chunk in a loop file's WAV header means.~~ **Mostly
  answered 2026-08-28** — see ringdown's H20. `200` is the tempo and `7 × 4`
  is the length in beats, both confirmed against the audio's own duration to
  within one 2048-sample DSP block. The guess recorded here was wrong: `8` and
  `4` are not a time signature, and `8` is not a length field at all. **A loop
  can now be imported knowing its tempo**, which was the point of asking.
  Still open, and needing several loops rather than one: which of the two
  length fields counts bars and which counts beats per bar, since only their
  product reaches the audio. `probe --index` collects exactly that.

## Findings

**W2 hardware run, 2026-08-27: the link works, and `den` does not.**

The metronome link is confirmed in both directions. `Detached` touched
nothing; `Follow` read the instrument's tempo; `Drive` sent 96 bpm and the
instrument reported 96 bpm back through a separate read; a second identical
sync correctly wrote nothing. **The done-condition is met: a tempo set in
Woodshed reaches the instrument.**

**`den` would not restore, and the reason was misdiagnosed for a day.** The run
read `{bpm: 60, num: 5, den: 8}`, wrote its own values, then wrote the original
back — and a later read returned `den: 4`. Four attempts could not put 8 back:
sent alone `UpdateMetronome` returns `false`, and sent alongside the other
fields it returns `true` and changes nothing.

**Retracted 2026-08-28 — the account below this line was wrong, and the
correction is ringdown's H23.**

What was concluded at the time: that `den` moved 8 → 4 because of a write, that
the guitar's display read 5/4 throughout, and that therefore a field changing by
half while the displayed denominator held still could not be the denominator.

What actually happened: **`den` was never written by anything sent from here.**
`UpdateMetronome` ignores that field entirely — retested 2026-08-28 across four
writes, up and down, including to values the instrument's own menu offers, with
`true` returned every time and the value never moving. The 8 → 4 that was
attributed to the run was the owner changing the setting on the guitar between
the two reads. The 5/4 display was observed *after* that change; the `den: 8`
read came *before* it. Two observations of different states, compared as though
they were one.

So `den` **is** the denominator, `ReadMetronome` reports it correctly, and the
instrument was in 5/8 when it said 5/8 and in 5/4 when it showed 5/4. Nothing
was disturbed, and this time not by luck: the write that was feared never
landed.

`num` *is* the numerator and does round-trip. Of the three fields, `bpm` and
`num` are writable and `den` is read-only over the protocol.

**What changed as a result:**

- `Connection::set_metronome` no longer sends `den` at all. It writes `bpm` and
  `num` and leaves the third field alone.
- `Metronome::beat_unit` is documented as the denominator, read but not
  written — see the closure below for why that stays true even now that
  writing it is possible.
- The hardware example still restores what it read, which succeeds because it
  only writes the two fields the protocol actually accepts.

**Two lessons, and the second is the one that cost the day.**

*Do not trust a `true` return.* This device reports success for writes it
silently discards. A write is confirmed by reading the value back, and for
anything the player can see, by the player looking at the instrument.

*An observation is evidence about the moment it was taken.* The whole `den`
mystery came from reading the wire at one moment, comparing it to a display seen
at another, and never re-reading after the setting changed in between. That
manufactured a firmware fault out of two correct readings, and the invented
fault then propagated into this plan, into ringdown's Findings, and into two
crates' documentation. **When a comparison is the evidence, both halves have to
come from the same moment** — which for hardware means read, act, read again,
and ask the owner what the screen says at each step.

**Closed — twice, because the first closure was wrong (ringdown H24).** An
earlier version of this paragraph declared `den` "not writable by anyone, the
vendor app included"; the owner disproved that with the app in a minute. The
real mechanism has two parts:

- **Ringdown was alphabetizing its JSON keys** (serde_json's default map), and
  the firmware's parser drops a `den` that arrives before `num`. With
  `preserve_order` enabled and declaration order pinned by test, `den` writes.
- **The firmware whitelists `{1, 2, 4, 16}`** — an exhaustive 1–32 (+256)
  sweep showed every other value silently refused with a `true` reply,
  including the 8 and 32 the guitar's own panel offers.

Woodshed keeps sending only `bpm` and `num` — now as a product choice, not a
protocol limit: denominator control that works for four values and silently
fails for the panel's other two is worse than none until there is a UI story
for it. A refused write is detectable only by read-back, which the `true`
reply actively obscures.

**The workspace had stopped resolving, and one upstream commit explains all of
it.** Every crate failed to build, including untouched ones. Three of Woodshed's
overrides pointed at things genet had removed in a single commit,
`55c05d11759 "Retire Stylo and the incumbent layout cone"`:

| Stale entry | Where | Why it broke |
|---|---|---|
| `stylo_taffy` | `Cargo.toml` patch + `.cargo/config.toml` | genet dropped Stylo; the package is gone |
| `taffy` | `Cargo.toml` patch + `.cargo/config.toml` | genet's fork is now the renamed `genet-taffy` |
| `genet-layout` | `.cargo/config.toml` + a `[profile.dev.package]` | the layout cone was retired |

All four fixes are deletions. Nothing in Woodshed depends on any of them:
`stylo_taffy` and `taffy` were patches with no dependents once genet renamed
its vendored forks with a `genet-` prefix, and Woodshed's own `CLAUDE.md`
already forbids depending on `genet-layout` directly. The entries outlived
their subjects.

**The repair stayed inside Woodshed.** The fault was diagnosed in genet but
every change is to Woodshed's own manifests, which is the difference between
fixing your own stale references and wandering into a neighbouring repo. The
lingering `components/genet-layout/` directory in the genet checkout, which has
no `Cargo.toml`, is genet's business and was left alone.

**Worth carrying forward:** a sibling repo retiring a component leaves this
kind of debris in every consumer that pins it locally, and the failure surfaces
as total — the workspace does not resolve *at all*, so it reads far more
alarming than "one retired component is still referenced". Any future genet
retirement should expect a sweep of consumers' `.cargo/config.toml` overrides,
which are the copies most easily forgotten because they are not committed
alongside the dependency that motivated them.

## Progress

- **2026-08-27** — Plan written.
- **2026-08-27 — W2 hardware-verified.** `Detached` changed nothing, `Follow`
  adopted the instrument tempo, and `Drive` sent 96 bpm, read it back, and
  avoided an identical second write. This closes W2; it does not integrate the
  instrument into Woodshed's views.
- **2026-08-27 — W2 initially written.** `session` module: `MetronomeLink`
  (Detached/Follow/Drive), `SyncOutcome`, and `Session` holding the instrument
  across actions with an explicit `release`. Thirteen tests, clippy clean. The
  hardware proof (`examples/metronome_link`) is written and builds; it reads
  the instrument's tempo, drives a different one, reads it back, and restores
  what it found. This entry records the pre-hardware state and is superseded by
  the verified receipt above.
- **2026-08-27 — W1 LANDED.** Verified inside the workspace: builds clean,
  five tests pass, no clippy findings in this crate. Required removing three
  stale genet overrides first (Findings).
- **2026-08-27 — W1 written, initially unverifiable.** `woodshed-instrument`
  created: `Connection` with a scope-based release that cannot leak on an error
  path, `InstrumentState` whose fields are all optional so unread is never
  displayed as zero, `Metronome` translating the wire's `bpm`/`num`/`den` into
  Woodshed's names once at the boundary, `Resonance` for the instrument's
  measured body modes, and a refusal list that blocks `ReadConfig` in code
  rather than trusting a comment. Five tests, clippy clean, built against the
  captured replies from the reference instrument. Added to the workspace
  members list; the workspace cannot build for the unrelated reason above.
