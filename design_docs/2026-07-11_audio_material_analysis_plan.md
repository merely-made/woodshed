# Audio-to-Material Analysis Research and Benchmark Plan

## Status

**ACTIVE RESEARCH, 2026-09-06.** The benchmark contract and scorer are landed;
its four smoke tests passed again in the musical-subsystem review. No
transcription or reasoning model is selected for the product. The research
refresh below narrows the next benchmark and identifies the current ESP owner.

This plan supersedes the recommendation in
[`2026-05-15_polyphonic_pitch_spike.md`](2026-05-15_polyphonic_pitch_spike.md).
That spike correctly identified guitar polyphony as difficult, but treated one
embedded detector as the decision. The current question is broader: how a
recording becomes inspectable musical evidence, catalog relations, and useful
practice material through replaceable local tools.

## Product Question

Strophe records durable performances. Woodshed should be able to use those
files immediately as loopable practice audio and, when analysis is requested,
derive tentative musical interpretations:

`recording -> observations -> catalog matches -> practice material`

The reverse path is equally important:

`Woodshed Card/Set -> rendered stems -> Strophe layers`

Woodshed-generated stems carry known notes, timing, voicing, instrument
context, and source Cards. They are ground-truth fixtures for evaluating the
return path and, later, for comparing an intended performance with a recorded
one.

## Boundary Decisions

### Audio is evidence; analysis is interpretation

Never rewrite a source recording because an analyzer changes its mind. A source
audio asset is immutable and content-addressed. Each analysis run records:

- analyzer and version;
- model/checkpoint identity when applicable;
- settings and supplied musical context;
- source digest and analyzed time span;
- observations with confidence;
- wall-clock runtime and execution device.

A corrected interpretation is a new analysis or a user-authored correction,
not a mutation of either the recording or prior output.

### Exchange files, not project internals

Woodshed should consume a decoded audio file plus a small sidecar carrying the
loop region, tempo/meter hints, source digest, and optional Strophe
session/track/phrase provenance. It must not open Strophe's Redb/Muniment
project store directly. Ordinary WAV is the first audio boundary; FLAC or other
formats can follow behind one decoder seam. Missing sidecar metadata only
reduces available context and does not make the audio unusable.

### Keep analyzers outside the realtime audio graph

This is offline work over a file or frozen capture. `woodshed-audio` retains
realtime input, transport, and playback ownership. Model loading, Python,
ONNX, GPU runtimes, and agents run behind an offline analyzer boundary and
publish normalized results when complete.

### Separate observations from catalog resolution

An analyzer may report notes, onsets, tempo candidates, chord labels, playing
techniques, or free-text descriptions. It does not directly create a Woodshed
Card. A deterministic resolver combines observations with optional context:

- instrument and tuning;
- capo and fret window;
- expected Set/Card;
- session tempo and meter;
- nearby catalog candidates;
- user corrections.

The resolver emits ranked catalog matches with explanations. Stage remains the
only action that turns a match into practice material.

### Agents are clients, not authorities

Any local or remote agent may call analyzers, compare their outputs, and explain
candidate interpretations. The normalized observation contract remains owned
by Woodshed. An agent cannot silently promote a guess to catalog truth or
replace source provenance.

### Use the existing intelligence stack

The Merely stack already has the cross-platform Burn strategy. Do not create a
Woodshed-owned native/web/mobile inference-runtime family beside it.

- `vates` owns capability-selected inference providers, streaming generation,
  cancellation, and the Armillary inference actor. A Vates-backed reasoner may
  orchestrate audio tools and explain competing interpretations.
- `sibylla` owns embedding providers, semantic retrieval, Burn-backed BERT, and
  Burn-backed vector-index acceleration. It retrieves catalog and practice
  context for an observation or region.
- `armillary` owns background actor execution and host wake-up rather than
  letting model work block the UI or realtime audio graph.

The uncovered seam is narrower: a structured audio-analysis provider that
accepts an audio asset plus context and returns normalized observations.
Vates's current `InferenceProvider` returns generated text, while Sibylla's
current `EmbeddingProvider` returns vectors; neither should be distorted to
pretend transcription is generation or embedding. The analyzer should follow
their provider/capability/stub/feature-gated-Burn pattern and be callable as a
tool by Vates. Keep it Woodshed-side until Strophe or another consumer proves
the provider contract is independently reusable.

## Current Tool Findings

### Baseline: existing Woodshed DSP

Woodshed already has monophonic FFT, cepstrum, and McLeod pitch detection plus
onset and tempo primitives. These form a cheap deterministic baseline and are
useful for isolated single-note exercises. They do not solve polyphonic note
tracking.

### First transcription adapter: Basic Pitch

Spotify Basic Pitch is the practical first external adapter:

- Apache-2.0;
- polyphonic and instrument-agnostic, with an explicit recommendation to use
  one instrument at a time;
- local CLI and Python API;
- note events, MIDI, pitch bends, and raw model output;
- Windows defaults to its ONNX serialization;
- arbitrary-length files are windowed and resampled to 22.05 kHz mono.

This matches Strophe's isolated mono layers well. The first spike's claim that
Woodshed should immediately embed Basic Pitch through `tract` is withdrawn:
the supported Windows ONNX path should be benchmarked out of process before a
Rust runtime is selected.

### Multi-instrument comparator: MT3

MT3 produces multi-instrument transcription and is Apache-2.0, but its public
path is a research-oriented T5X/Colab stack, has no releases, and is explicitly
not a supported Google product. It is a useful quality comparator, not the
first integration target.

Source: <https://github.com/magenta/mt3>

### Rhythm and tonal reference: Essentia

Essentia's extractor can emit beats, BPM, onsets, tuning, pitch-class profiles,
keys, and chord summaries as JSON. It is valuable for benchmark comparison.
The library is AGPL-3.0 and its published pretrained models are non-commercial
unless separately licensed, so it must not become a Woodshed product
dependency without a deliberate licensing decision.

<https://essentia.upf.edu/licensing_information.html>

### Optional source separation

Strophe layers normally isolate one contributor and should be analyzed before
source separation. For imported mixes, separation is an optional preprocessing
stage. Meta's SAM Audio supports text-, span-, and visual-prompted separation
and publishes checkpoints and evaluation tooling under its own SAM license.
Its resource cost and license require evaluation. The older Demucs repository
is unmaintained and should be a legacy baseline only.

<https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs>

### Optional semantic reasoners

Gemma 4 is one plausible local client, not a privileged dependency. Its native
audio path accepts 30 seconds of mono 16 kHz audio. That is suitable for coarse
description and short-region reasoning but is not evidence of note-accurate
transcription. Other local multimodal models and text-only agents consuming
specialist outputs belong in the same benchmark lane.

## Benchmark Corpus

The corpus is layered so a failure identifies the broken capability.

### A. Synthetic catalog truth

Render scales, chord voicings, arpeggios, and short progressions directly from
Woodshed. Vary register, tempo, note duration, strum spread, and dynamics.
These cases have exact note and catalog truth but limited timbral realism.

### B. Human isolated performances

Record known Woodshed Cards through Strophe-style mono capture. Cover guitar,
bass, ukulele, and at least one custom tuning. Preserve the intended Card and
ask the player to mark mistakes rather than correcting the recording.

### C. Effects and capture conditions

Re-record or process a subset through clean amplification, distortion,
compression, delay, and reverb; include microphone and direct-input paths.
This tests robustness without changing the intended material.

### D. Mixtures

Combine known stems into two- and four-part mixes. Evaluate direct
transcription and optional separation plus transcription separately. Mixture
results must not obscure isolated-layer performance.

### E. Open performances

Add short improvisations with human annotations and competing plausible
interpretations. These test usefulness and confidence calibration rather than
only exact-note recovery.

Do not use private Strophe recordings as a published corpus by default. Corpus
entries need explicit consent and redistribution terms.

## Normalized Result Contract

The initial scaffold uses JSON with:

- `schema_version`;
- `run` metadata: analyzer, version, source identifier, settings, elapsed time;
- `notes`: onset, offset, MIDI pitch, confidence;
- `chords`: time span, root pitch class, quality, confidence;
- `tempo`: BPM and confidence;
- `catalog_candidates`: stable Woodshed catalog ID, score, and reasons.

This is a benchmark interchange format, not yet the durable application model.
`scripts/audio_analysis_bench.py` currently scores notes and catalog retrieval.
Adapters translate native analyzer output into this format; Woodshed never asks
every model to implement an in-process Rust trait.

## Metrics

### Machine metrics

- note onset precision/recall/F1 at 50 ms and 50 cents;
- note onset+offset F1, with offset tolerance of 20% or 50 ms;
- average overlap for matched notes;
- tempo absolute and octave-aware error;
- chord root, quality, and duration-weighted segment accuracy;
- catalog top-1, top-3, and top-5 retrieval;
- confidence calibration;
- runtime, peak memory, model size, and cold-start cost.

Use `mir_eval` as the comparison reference where its transcription metrics
apply. The local scorer intentionally has a small auditable implementation for
smoke tests, not a claim of benchmark standardization.

### Product metrics

- Can the user see why a catalog match was proposed?
- Can a wrong note or chord be corrected without re-running everything?
- Does the result produce a useful rehearsal fragment or comparison?
- Are uncertainty and competing interpretations visible?
- Does analysis remain optional and local by default?

## Graph Projection

`woodshed-graph` should eventually project, rather than own, the analysis log.
Likely nodes are source asset, analysis run, temporal region, observation,
catalog material, staged Card, and practice event. Likely relations include:

- `derived from`;
- `detected in`;
- `supports` / `contradicts`;
- `realizes`;
- `variation of`;
- `corrected by`;
- `rehearsed as`.

Confidence, time span, analyzer identity, and evidence stay attached to the
analysis observation. Catalog formulas remain stable truth nodes.

## Plan

### R1. Freeze the benchmark contract

Land representative normalized fixtures, validation, and smoke scoring. Do not
add model dependencies to the Cargo workspace.

Done when malformed observations fail clearly, matching is one-to-one, note
and catalog metrics are deterministic, and the fixtures run on Windows with
the standard Python installation.

### R2. Generate catalog fixtures

Add a non-realtime generator that renders a small balanced catalog subset and
writes source audio plus exact normalized annotations. Start with Major,
Minor, Dominant 7, one altered chord, two scales, two arpeggiation directions,
and one progression.

Done when every generated file can be reproduced from a committed manifest and
its annotation points back to stable Woodshed catalog IDs.

### R3. Adapt Basic Pitch

Pin a tested Basic Pitch version in an isolated environment, invoke its CLI,
and normalize note events. Record runtime/model metadata. Do not bundle it with
the application.

Done when one command analyzes all A/B cases, failures are per-case rather than
fatal to the run, and results are reproducible on the reference Windows host.

### R4. Test context-constrained resolution

Resolve raw note events twice: blind, then with instrument/tuning/capo/tempo and
expected-neighborhood context. Keep analyzer output unchanged so the resolver's
contribution is measurable.

Done when the report distinguishes transcription quality from catalog-retrieval
quality and identifies cases where context causes a wrong confident match.

Use Sibylla for semantic candidate retrieval only after deterministic catalog
matching has a measured baseline. A Vates provider may compare or explain the
ranked candidates, but its prose is not a metric input and cannot replace the
structured resolver output.

### R5. Compare optional lanes

Add at most one multi-instrument transcription comparator, one separation
comparator for D cases, and one local reasoner/agent. A candidate enters only if
it has runnable weights or binaries, compatible research use, and a normalizer.

Done when each lane has measured quality, resource cost, license, install
friction, and failure behavior. Popularity alone is not a selection criterion.

### R6. Decide the product slice

Choose the smallest capability that clears a written quality floor. Likely
first slices are isolated-layer note extraction plus catalog suggestions, or
performance-against-known-Card comparison. Full mix-to-tab is not the default.

Done when the selected feature has a local execution path, visible uncertainty,
user correction, provenance, cancellation, and a setting controlling whether
analysis runs at all.

## Stop Rules

- Do not embed an ML runtime before the out-of-process baseline is useful.
- Do not make full-mix separation a prerequisite for isolated Strophe layers.
- Do not infer string/fret positions as facts when several fingerings fit.
- Do not treat an agent's prose as structured analysis.
- Do not publish or train on user recordings without explicit consent.
- Do not merge analysis observations into catalog truth.

## Progress

### Research refresh, 2026-09-06

The current generation/comparison/inference map and the live voicing-search
probe are recorded once in
[the musical projections plan](2026-09-04_musical_projections_plan.md#musical-subsystem-research-2026-09-06).
The July references to Strophe mean Hocket. New inference integrations should
target Mere's `esp::infer`; embeddings target `esp::embed`. Vates and Sibylla
now re-export those contracts for compatibility. Woodshed currently has neither
as an audio-analysis provider.

Keep three outputs distinct: **observations** (estimated notes/onsets and
uncertainty), **interpretations** (candidate material under stated context),
and **suggestions** (a proposed exercise or realization serving a player goal).
Known Card pitches are ground truth for rendered fixtures, but using expected
Card context to resolve a recording can conceal a wrong performance. Always
retain a blind result beside the constrained result and test deliberately
wrong supplied context.

Basic Pitch remains a reasonable first baseline, not a selection made from a
model leaderboard. Its official implementation says it works best on one
instrument at a time; note-event CSV output supports the existing normalizer.
Its current packaging makes Windows runtime selection Python-version-dependent:
the ONNX default applies below Python 3.11, while newer Python selectors pull
TensorFlow. Pin interpreter, package, runtime, model bytes, and invocation;
record cold/warm runtime and memory separately. No model installation or run
was performed in this review.
[Official README](https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch),
[package selectors](https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch/blob/main/pyproject.toml),
[model paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09893).

R2-R4 should produce one reproducible report with these groups:

- Generated known material, including altered chords, doubled voices,
  arpeggiated attacks, rests, repeated notes, and timing variation.
- Independent human recordings held out by player and musical passage, not
  random windows of recordings already used to choose thresholds. GuitarSet
  supplies guitar audio and annotations; pin a version and known-error
  exclusions from its official repository. Treat any suggested fingering as
  an alternative realization unless string/fret evidence actually supports it.
  [GuitarSet record](https://zenodo.org/records/3371780),
  [known annotation errors](https://github.com/marl/GuitarSet).
- Robustness cases: silence, incomplete notes, detuning, distorted/roomy audio,
  wrong tuning/capo hints, out-of-catalog material, repetitions, skipped bars,
  and interrupted capture. Report abstention and confidently wrong cases.

Report onset/pitch F1 and onset/pitch/offset F1 separately, with documented
tolerances, then catalog retrieval and user-correction burden. The existing
scorer performs maximum one-to-one matching, but its four tests and synthetic
JSON pair are not a transcription benchmark. It does not yet require the full
source-digest/analyzer/model/run provenance listed in this plan. Tighten that
validation when the first real adapter enters. Use the independent reference
metrics for a published comparison:
[mir_eval transcription](https://mir-eval.readthedocs.io/latest/api/transcription.html).

Performance comparison requires an alignment result of its own. A monotonic
time alignment can help with local tempo drift, but repeated/skipped sections
need explicit structural handling and uncertainty; ordinary DTW is inadequate
for those cases. The first acceptance corpus must include a restart and skipped
bar before the UI calls a passage wrong.
[Grachten et al., 2013](https://www.cp.jku.at/research/papers/Grachten_etal_Ismir_2013.pdf).

The strongest first product experiment is an isolated recorded phrase against
a known Card/Set, with uncertain events visible and correction available.
Rendering varied practice phrases is already a deterministic generation task;
an LLM may explain or propose a typed candidate through ESP later, while the
same musical validator checks it. No selected model or confidence floor is
claimed until R2-R4 produce held-out evidence.

### 2026-07-11

- Audited Woodshed's Set/Card, input analyzer, and catalog-graph seams plus
  Strophe's immutable phrase/media boundary.
- Re-evaluated the 2026-05-15 polyphonic spike against current tools.
- Selected Basic Pitch as the first adapter to benchmark, not a committed
  product dependency.
- Kept MT3, separation, and local reasoners as optional comparator lanes.
- Landed the normalized JSON smoke scorer and fixtures.
- Confirmed `basic-pitch` 0.4.0 is published but not installed in the reference
  Python environment. R3 requires a disposable pinned environment and must
  measure setup friction separately from inference.
- Corrected the runtime framing after auditing sibling repos: Vates already
  owns inference and actors, while Sibylla already owns Burn embedding and
  retrieval. The plan now adds only the missing structured audio-analysis tool
  seam and keeps agents and semantic retrieval in their existing owners.
