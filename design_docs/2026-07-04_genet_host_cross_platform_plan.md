# Genet host: one codebase for desktop + web (mobile downstream)

Woodshed's UI moves from masonry/xilem (the mark-ik/xilem `woodshed-theme`
fork) to **xilem_serval**: genet renders the app, on desktop and in the
browser, from one DOM-shaped view tree. This supersedes the web-vs-native
split in [2026-06-14_web_profile_plan.md](2026-06-14_web_profile_plan.md);
that plan's Tier 0 seams carry forward here.

Status: **active desktop-alpha hardening.** The Woodshed-side Genet migration
and S5 parity cut are complete; browser, cross-desktop receipts, and publishing
remain separate release work.

## Why

- **xilem_serval is a DOM-shaped xilem backend.** It diffs a xilem view tree
  into genet's `ScriptedDom` (the third backend beside masonry and
  `xilem_web`, same `xilem_core`). A Woodshed written against it is already
  web-vocabulary; there is no second view layer to maintain for the browser.
- **The browser path is proven, not projected.** `genet/examples/genet_web_smoke`
  (genet `2422044ad1a`, receipt PASS in Chrome 2026-07-04) renders a
  woodshed-mock UI through the full chain on wasm32/WebGPU: xilem-serval →
  ScriptedDom → genet-layout → PaintList → paint_list_render → netrender →
  canvas. Pills nav, sidebar, fretboard dots, Roboto text via the new
  `genet_layout::register_host_font` seam.
- **Ecosystem direction.** Woodshed becomes genet's second consumer app
  after meerkat, pressuring the HTML lanes (popups, text input, scroll,
  catalogs) the way Strophe pressures the audio layer. The mark-ik/xilem
  fork and its wgpu-28 skew retire.

**Alternative on file: Dioxus 0.7.** One RSX codebase, `dx` bundles
installers for all five targets, hot patching, Dioxus Native (Blitz/wgpu).
Strongest tooling for pure product speed; not chosen because it feeds
nothing back into the Merely stack and adds a foreign framework. Revisit
trigger: genet churn blocking Woodshed shipping for an extended stretch.

## Shape

- **`woodshedding`** (theory) and **`audio-primitives`**: untouched.
- **`woodshed-audio`**: stays the engine layer, host-agnostic. cpal bumped
  0.15 → 0.18 (2026-07-04, `aaa7cde`); 0.18 ships webaudio + audioworklet
  output backends for the web lane.
- **`woodshed-views`** (new): xilem_serval view fns + the CSS sheets. The
  seed-derived theme engine keeps its OKLCH math and emits CSS (variables +
  sheets) instead of masonry properties. Slate/Ember and the P1-P3 redesign
  language re-express here.
- **`woodshed-genet`** (new host): winit window + netrender present +
  input dispatch, the meerkat main.rs shape (borrow its harness patterns,
  don't import meerkat).
- **`woodshed-web`** (new host): canvas + rAF/resize loop + input
  translation to `GenetAppRunner::dispatch_*`, generalized from
  genet_web_smoke. PWA manifest + service worker when deploy lands.
- **`woodshed-xilem`**: frozen at migration start, deleted at the parity
  cut (S5). Zero users; no parallel maintenance.

Genet/netrender are consumed as git deps (mark-ik remotes) with the usual
gitignored local `paths` override for development. The woodshed workspace
must mirror genet's `[patch.crates-io]` set (stylo, stylo_atoms, taffy,
sonic-rs); this is a standing cost of consuming genet outside its
workspace and the smoke already models it.

## Platform seams (from the web profile plan, still the spine)

- **Audio (W0.1)**: `AudioBackend` trait. Native = cpal 0.18. Web = Web
  Audio output; tuner input via `getUserMedia` + AudioWorklet posting
  Float32Array hops to the wasm pitch detector. The tuner listens in the
  browser; cpal upstream input support is not the gate.
- **Storage (W0.2)**: native = fs (`directories`); web = **OPFS** (matches
  the Mere direction), localStorage acceptable for first settings.
- **Time (W0.3)**: `web-time` pattern, already landed in genet-layout and
  netrender where the smoke hit it.
- **Timers (W0.4)**: the ten tokio interval loops move behind a host
  scheduler seam. The metronome moves to audio-clock lookahead scheduling
  regardless of platform; that is an upgrade on desktop too.
- **MIDI**: native = midir; web = Web MIDI where present (Chromium, Firefox
  108+; Safari never), feature-detected.

## Phases

- **S0 — scaffold.** `woodshed-views` + `woodshed-genet` crates in the
  workspace, genet/netrender git deps resolving, patch mirror in place,
  `woodshed-xilem` still building. *Done when:* a genet host window opens
  and renders a static sheet on Windows.
- **S1 — Stage walking skeleton.** Real `AppState` behind it: pills nav,
  catalog sidebar, fretboard as transform-positioned DOM dots, theme CSS
  from the seed engine. *Done when:* Stage renders from live state and a
  click selects a scale.
- **S2 — interaction spine.** Pointer/key dispatch through the runner;
  dropdowns via xilem_serval `select`; text fields via `styled_text_field`.
  *Done when:* instrument/tuning/root selection, lens switching, and
  keyboard focus traversal work.
- **S3 — engines wired.** cpal playback, tuner, metronome, MIDI on desktop
  through the W0 seams (seams land here even though desktop could bypass
  them). *Done when:* sound + tuner parity with woodshed-xilem on Windows.
- **S4 — screen parity + redesign P4-P6.** Practice, Song timeline,
  Rehearsal, Settings. The outstanding redesign phases (fretboard-layout
  setting, Rehearsal filmstrip + transport deck, Practice recipe tiles)
  land directly in the new stack; they are not built twice.
  *Done when:* every screen exists in woodshed-genet and the redesign
  plan's P4-P6 done-conditions hold there.
- **S5 — parity cut.** Delete `woodshed-xilem`, the xilem fork dep, and
  `xilem_fork_patches.md` (archive). Cross-platform desktop validation on
  the iMac / Fedora / Mint machines. *Done when:* main builds with no
  mark-ik/xilem reference and the app runs on all four desktop targets.
- **W1 — web shell.** rAF/resize/input loop over the smoke's chain; host
  fonts bundled; OPFS settings. *Done when:* the S1 Stage screen runs in
  Chrome with working mouse input.
- **W2 — web audio.** Web Audio output + AudioWorklet tuner behind W0.1;
  metronome on the audio clock. *Done when:* the browser build plays the
  click and the tuner tracks a live mic.
- **W3 — deploy.** cargo + wasm-bindgen + a static host (Pages or
  Cloudflare), release wasm profile, PWA manifest, `cargo-about` license
  aggregation. *Done when:* a public URL serves the app and installs as a
  PWA.
- **M (downstream, not scheduled)** — mobile: a wry/Tauri shell around the
  web build with the native Rust audio core compiled in. Recorded only;
  no work until W3 ships.

## Known risks and gaps

- **Genet churn.** Active concurrent development (shell-partition, paint
  emission). Pin via lock to known-good genet commits; bump deliberately.
- **Genet-side feature gaps Woodshed will surface**: overlay popups for
  the header dropdowns (meerkat has the patterns), IME/text-input depth,
  a11y tree exposure on web (canvas rendering carries no DOM a11y; genet
  has accesskit plumbing, browser exposure is unproven).
- **audio-widgets / xilem-components** stay masonry-based with Strophe as
  their consumer once Woodshed leaves; Woodshed's genet equivalents grow
  fresh in `woodshed-views`. Decide their long-term stewardship in the
  Strophe context, not here.
- **WebGPU reach**: Chrome/Edge/Safari 26/recent Firefox. No DOM fallback;
  acceptable for a practice tool, revisit only if reach data says otherwise.
- **Unpushed dependencies**: the receipt commits (genet `2422044ad1a`,
  netrender `83e4be37a` + `6520d74ed`) exist locally; git-dep consumption
  needs them pushed.

## Findings

- genet engine core (xilem-serval, genet-scripted-dom, genet-layout)
  checks clean on wasm32 from current main; the June 6 P1 pass landed.
- Browser swapchains reject vello's storage-texture write; render into an
  intermediate `STORAGE_BINDING | TEXTURE_BINDING` RGBA8 texture and blit
  (`wgpu::util::TextureBlitter`). Every web shell must do this.
- `std::time::Instant` panics on wasm; `web-time` fixes landed in
  genet-layout and netrender. Audit woodshed code for the same during S3.
- xilem_serval's control set (button, select, slider, radio_group,
  styled_text_field, overlay) already covers most of Woodshed's widget
  needs; the header dropdown work from redesign P3b maps to `overlay_at`.

## Progress

- 2026-07-10: **Windows-alpha release surface.** Added Windows CI (core tests
  plus host check), a tag-triggered `v*` release workflow, and a manual
  artifact path. `scripts/package-windows.ps1` packages the optimized host as
  a portable `Woodshed-<version>-windows-x86_64.zip`, includes the project
  licenses, README, release instructions, and Cargo.lock inventory, and emits
  a SHA-256 sidecar. It honors `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` for local builds. The first
  exercised package was `0.1.0-alpha.1`: 25.8 MB executable, 9.9 MB ZIP, and
  the expected six package entries. This is intentionally not an installer:
  application icon, signing/SmartScreen reputation, and third-party notice
  aggregation remain before a broadly advertised release. Refreshed the
  maintainer-owned `PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md` at the same time so the canonical
  product description no longer claims the retired Iced stack or an already
  shipped web/mobile product.
- 2026-07-09: **Adaptive-shell foundation.** CSD titlebar controls and their
  desktop-only drag/resize behavior moved out of the shared product root and
  into `woodshed-genet`; a future browser host therefore composes the same
  app content without inheriting unusable window controls. The desktop host now
  derives Wide / Medium / Narrow width bands from logical window width. Below
  1180px the Stage catalog moves below the neck; below 760px navigation wraps,
  controls enlarge, the fretboard scrolls rather than compressing, and recipes
  become a single column. Native startup dimensions now clamp to the primary
  monitor with a 24px margin instead of assuming a 1100px-wide display. This
  is the adaptable-shell seam, not yet a web host or a mobile layout receipt.
- 2026-07-08: **S5 parity cut (woodshed half) — woodshed-xilem deleted.**
  The old Masonry app is gone (`git rm`); woodshed-genet is now THE
  woodshed app. The mark-ik/xilem fork stays for now: audio-widgets +
  xilem-components (Masonry-coupled shared crates) are still consumed by
  Strophe, and because they're woodshed members their `workspace = true`
  fork deps resolve against woodshed's workspace — so the fork can't leave
  woodshed without relocating them, and Strophe still needs it. Full
  retirement is a family-wide move: refactor Strophe onto `xilem_serval`
  and reincarnate the widget work as chisel leaves (audio-widgets is pure
  custom paint — a canonical chisel-leaf fit; xilem-components is mostly
  reactive structure that `xilem_serval` does natively, so it dissolves).
  Deferred to that Strophe refactor. Manifest housekeeping: synced
  woodshed's `[patch.crates-io] stylo`/`stylo_atoms` mirror to genet's
  fork (`mark-ik/stylo`, `mark-ik/servo-media-features` branch — genet
  moved stylo there); build woodshed **from its own cwd** so the
  local-genet `[patch]` applies (Code-root + `--manifest-path` falls back
  to the pinned git genet, which lacks the newer transition API).
- 2026-07-08: **Polish tail — window fixes, CSS transitions, Hero receipt.**
  - Right-edge clip fixed (`.root` was `width:100%` + 32px padding in
    content-box, so it rendered wider than the window and the search field
    and CSD × spilled off the right and clipped): `box-sizing: border-box`.
    The off-screen × had also caused a mis-aimed click to hit another window.
  - Resize-arrow cursors on border hover (undecorated CSD windows get none
    from the OS): `edge_cursor` + `update_resize_cursor`, 8px grab margin.
    Shipped with the clip fix + a default-window shrink (720→664 logical,
    top-anchored, so it clears the taskbar on a 720-tall laptop screen) as
    `c7044fe`.
  - CSS transitions on genet's new `transition_events` / `tick_animations`:
    subtle hover/active fades on buttons, tabs, lenses, and cards. The host
    ticks genet's animation clock each frame (in redraw before `apply`,
    and in hover before `set_interaction`, so a flip runs from *now* not a
    stale idle clock) and requests frames only while
    `has_active_animations()`, so idle surfaces stay idle.
  - Hero-layout receipt captured (fretboard full-width on top, catalog a
    wrapping strip beneath).
- 2026-07-07: **S4 slice 15 — the looper (audio depth IV).** Record your
  part into a song bar as it loops past — overdub or replace — and clear
  it. The Song screen gains a Rec / Overdub-Replace / Clear-loop row and
  a ⟳ marker on looped bars. The song engine already recorded live input
  into per-bar audio buffers (draining the looper-capture ring while
  `recording`); this slice wires that ring to the input engine (the same
  onset+capture registration slice 14 added), exposes arm / stop / clear
  / mode plus recording-state + per-bar-loop reflection through the audio
  seam, and drives it from the host: arm the edit-cursor bar
  (`PendingChange::StartRecording` + enable capture); on the SR-16 model
  it records when the loop reaches the armed bar. Recorded loops now
  survive song edits (carried across `set_song` by bar index). Also
  removed a pre-existing per-frame chord-cache resync during playback
  (read-only `SongEngineHandle` accessors instead of `with_song`).
  Receipt: the Song screen renders the loop controls over a 6-bar
  progression; build green. Recording itself is Mark's to confirm with a
  mic.
- 2026-07-07: **S4 slice 14 — latency calibration (audio depth III).**
  Measure the real input→output round-trip lag: play a lead of clicks,
  tap along, read the number. A Settings panel (Calibrate → "Tap along
  N/M" → Accept / Retry) drives the built-and-tested `CalibrationSession`
  (correlates click times against detected onsets, takes the median).
  The input engine now registers the onset analyzer (plus the
  looper-capture analyzer, shared with slice 15) beside pitch;
  calibration owns the metronome engine during a run (the host gates
  `set_metronome`) and restores the click after. New `CalibrationStatus`
  plus five `AudioBackend` methods; the accepted latency is stored as the
  active compensation (the onset-timing feedback widget that consumes it
  is the natural follow-up). Receipt: the panel renders in Settings
  ("Latency: uncalibrated" / Calibrate); build green, 31 core + 126 audio
  tests pass. The measurement itself is Mark's to run with a mic.
- 2026-07-07: **S4 slice 13 — MIDI in/out (audio depth II).** Woodshed
  talks to your rig. A MIDI panel in Settings: input/output port pickers,
  "Sync to clock" (slave the transport BPM to an incoming MIDI clock),
  "Send clock" (emit 24-PPQN clock + Start/Stop so external gear follows
  Woodshed's tempo), a status line + live event readout, and Refresh.
  - The engine layer (`woodshed_audio::midi` — byte parse, clock-sync
    BPM derivation, `MidiIn`/`MidiOut` over `midir`) was built + tested
    but never consumed by any app (the old xilem app only ever mentioned
    "future MIDI pickers"); this wires it. New
    `woodshed_core::midi::MidiBackend` seam (parallel to
    AudioBackend/Storage); desktop `MidiHost` over `midir`. Input is a
    connected `MidiIn` (its reader thread queues events + the clock-sync
    derives BPM, host-polled); output is a dedicated clock-generator
    thread that owns the connection, so no `midir` handle crosses a
    thread boundary. The host polls clock BPM in redraw (slaving the
    transport and pushing `set_metronome`), reflects the event readout,
    and connects per the dropdowns after dispatch. Transient (not
    persisted — port availability is session-dependent). Receipt: the
    panel renders on a no-MIDI machine (In/Out "None", "no clock"); build
    green, 126 audio + 31 core tests pass. The clock sync itself is
    Mark's to confirm with gear.
- 2026-07-07: **S4 slice 12 — hear the theory (audio depth I).** The
  fretboard now sounds. A "♪ Hear" button on the Stage transport row
  voices the active lens's material; the same button on the Rehearsal
  deck voices the current card. Running an arpeggio or exercise sonifies
  each step as the transport lands on it (the arpeggio climbs audibly);
  a running rehearsal voices each card as it comes up.
  - **The engine already had most of it.** `woodshed-audio` carried a
    complete one-shot voice path (`SongEngineHandle::play_note_now`,
    `oneshot_voices`/`oneshot_clock`, mixed while the song is stopped)
    plus `chord_audio::render_chord` (additive synth, strum/block, ADSR)
    — but the genet host's thin `AudioBackend` seam only exposed
    metronome + tuner + song, so none of it was reachable. This slice
    widens the seam, it doesn't write DSP.
  - Engine: added `play_chord_now(pitches, dur, strum_ms)` beside
    `play_note_now` (strum offset = block / gentle strum / arpeggiated
    cascade), factoring the shared one-shot push. 2 tests.
  - Core seam: `AudioBackend::preview_pitches` + `preview_note` (default
    no-op, so a backend that can't voice stays silent — the web host
    fills these over Web Audio later). Core `StageState` gained
    `voicing_pitches` / `voicing_preview` / `card_voicing` (chord+scale
    tones via `ScaleFormula`/`ChordFormula::apply_to` → `Pitch::frequency`)
    and `arpeggio_current_pitch_hz` / `exercise_current_pitch_hz` for the
    step-through. 6 core tests (31 total green).
  - Host: `CpalBackend` forwards the two preview calls to the song
    engine; `main.rs` sonifies the arpeggio/exercise step on advance and
    voices the rehearsal card on land (redraw), and consumes a
    `preview_requested` flag after dispatch (the same host-flag idiom as
    rewind / chrome). Views add the "♪ Hear" control (accent-tinted, no
    toolbar reorg) + `UiState::preview_voicing` (Rehearsal card vs. Stage
    lens by tab). Receipt: Stage renders with ♪ Hear inline on the
    transport row, launches clean (no panic). Audible confirmation is
    Mark's by ear — click ♪ Hear or run an arpeggio.
  - Deferred (audio depth II+): MIDI in/out, calibration/timing, the
    bar-aligned looper — all still built-and-tested in `woodshed-audio`,
    waiting on the same seam-widening pattern.
- 2026-07-06: **S4 slice 11 — corpus search field (genet text input
  dogfood).** A small always-on search field in the nav row (right of
  the tabs, no toolbar reorg). `woodshed_core::search::search_corpus`
  ranks one query (exact → prefix → word-start → substring) across every
  named catalog: scales, chords, arpeggios, progressions, exercises,
  practice recipes, tunings (`SearchHit` names the target). The view is
  xilem_serval's real `text_field` over a `TextInput` in `UiState`;
  results drop down as a positioned overlay; clicking one runs
  `apply_search_hit` (jump to the lens/tab, or fill the set for a
  recipe, or swap the tuning) and clears the field. Driven receipts:
  typed "dorian" → ranked list (exact Dorian first) → clicked → landed
  on Stage/Scales/A Dorian; "caged" → three recipe hits. 5 core tests.
  - **Genet dogfood outcomes**: real text input works end to end
    (caret, key routing to the focused field, focus-on-click). Two
    engine-behavior lessons for any genet UI: `<input>` is `inline` in
    genet's UA sheet (Stylo default) so it needs `display: block` to
    take a width (meerkat sets this too); and `width` is content-box, so
    a padded field wants `box-sizing: border-box` or its border-box
    overflows the wrap (was clipping at the window edge). Both are host
    CSS, not engine gaps.
  - Note: the CSD chrome (our own title/buttons, no OS red frame) already
    shipped in slice 8 — visible in every screenshot since. The frame is
    already ours; further chrome refinement stays in the polish tail.
- 2026-07-06: **S4 slice 10 — the song editor.** The song lane is now a
  first-class core `SongDoc { name, bars, one_shot, click }` (replacing
  the split `song_name`/`song_bars` fields, which also un-grew the
  `capture` arg list). `SongBar` gained `root_pc` + the edit verbs
  (`revoice`, `cycle_root`/`cycle_formula`/`toggle_silent`, `nudge_bpm`,
  `cycle_beats`, `cycle_length`); `SongDoc` the structural verbs
  (`add_bar_after`/`duplicate`/`remove`/`move_bar`). The Song tab:
  transport deck (adds Once/Loop + Click toggles), bar-ops row (+ Bar /
  Dup / Remove / Move ◀▶), selectable timeline chips (edit cursor ringed
  tertiary, play cursor secondary), and a per-bar editor row (root,
  chord, silent, tempo ±, meter, length, section-label cycle). Bars are
  built from scratch OR laid down from a progression; the whole doc
  persists. Driven receipt: three bars added from empty, bar 1 edited to
  a D Minor "Verse" (chip + editor updated live), song survived
  relaunch (persist), Play voiced it (deck showed Stop). Backend
  `set_song(&SongDoc)` now carries `one_shot`/`click` into the engine.
  - Bug caught + fixed in-slice: the empty-state hid the `+ Bar` button
    (it lived only in the non-empty ops row) — the placeholder pointed
    at a control that wasn't there; the ops row now shows on empty too.
- 2026-07-06: **S4 slice 9 — the card editor + dwell transport.**
  Rehearsal's editor strip edits the cursor card in place (persisted
  with the set): touch cycle (block → arp up-down → up → down), hold
  cycle (manual → 2/4/8 bars → 30s), per-card tempo override (card bpm
  wins over transport), pinned fret-window nudge + free. Core:
  `dots_for_card` honors the window (first Setting-fidelity piece);
  `card_dwell` maps Hold to wall-clock. The rehearsal deck gains
  Run/Pause: the host advances on each card's own dwell, parks on
  manual cards, and stops at the end when loop is off. Driven receipt:
  2-bar hold at 120 auto-advanced to card 2/12 at the 4s mark, played
  card dimmed, board re-resolved with the window applied, transport
  parked on the next card's manual hold.
  - **Workspace lesson (cost an hour): never use cargo's global
    `paths` override.** It matches by package NAME graph-wide, so the
    xilem fork's `xilem_core` hijacked genet's vendored `xilem_core`
    (surfaced when a concurrent genet edit extended a trait). A
    source-keyed `[patch]` can't express it either (two path-sourced
    same-version packages collide in the lock). Resolution: the
    dormant xilem fork rides its git dep; only the active genet
    family keeps local overrides.
- 2026-07-05: **S4 slice 8 — P4 fretboard layouts + CSD chrome + polish
  batch.**
  - **P4**: `BoardLayout` (Two pane / Hero / Full canvas) as a Settings
    picker, persisted. Structure branches in `stage_screen`; sizing
    rides descendant CSS off a root class (`.layout-canvas .dot {...}`),
    so every lens board gets the treatment without touching the grid
    renderers. All three render the same resolved positions. Driven:
    Full canvas (sidebar gone, 36px dots); Hero's branch shares the
    machinery but hasn't been screenshot-driven yet.
  - **CSD chrome**: undecorated window; our own chrome row (title,
    drag surface, minimize / maximize-toggle / close with danger
    hover), host consumes request flags after dispatch
    (`drag_window` while the press is live), 8-direction edge resize
    with a 6px grab margin. The old red OS title bar is gone.
  - **Polish**: dot labels vertically centered (line-height); Escape
    closes open selects; `:focus` styling wired (focused travels in
    the InteractionState with hover, refreshed after Tab).
  - Known nits: the × button clips slightly at the right edge
    (chrome row padding); chrome buttons + drag + edge resize not yet
    synthetically driven; Hero layout needs its receipt.
- 2026-07-05: **S4 slice 7 — Song tab: timeline + engine playback. The
  tab row is complete (no placeholders left).**
  `woodshed_core::song::SongBar` is the neutral bar DTO (display
  strings + pre-computed chord-tone frequencies, so backends stay
  theory-free — the ChordRef posture); `song_from_progression`
  materializes the selected progression as one labeled bar block per
  chord ("Send to Song"). The audio seam grows song methods
  (set_song / transport / rewind / live bar cursor); CpalBackend
  converts to `woodshed_audio::Song` and runs the real `SongEngine`
  (third cpal stream). The Song tab: transport deck (Play/Stop,
  Rewind, From progression), bar-chip timeline (numeral, chord, bpm)
  with the current chip ringed by the engine's live cursor on the
  animation chain. Song name + bars persist. Driven receipt: I-IV-V
  in A laid onto the timeline, playing, captured at bar 2/3 with the
  IV/D chip highlighted (cursor math checks: 3.2s at 120bpm 4/4).
  Deferred (the song editor deep end): add/remove/reorder bars,
  per-bar chord/tempo/meter editing, sections, one-shot mode toggle,
  click toggle, bar recording/looper — tracked for a dedicated
  editing slice.
- 2026-07-05: **S4 slice 6 — Practice tab (P6 recipe tiles) + `:hover`
  via a new engine feature.**
  - **Engine: `IncrementalLayout::set_interaction`** (genet
    `b4e0edc051f`) — the cascade had `restyle_for_interaction` but the
    retained session had no way to reach it, so no host had ever wired
    `:hover`. The new method lands on the same paths as `apply`
    (RepaintOnly for color-tier rules, full relayout for geometry,
    Unchanged when nothing matched); woodshed-genet is the first
    consumer (CursorMoved → hit test → restyle on target change).
    Hover rules added across the app's sheets.
  - **Practice tab**: the P6 treatment — `woodshedding::practice`
    recipes as a CSS **grid** of tiles (name, blurb, card count),
    one tap fills the rehearsal set (`set_from_practice`: cards with
    PracticeSet provenance + pinned fret windows, loop-all) and jumps
    to Rehearsal.
  - Driven receipts: 3-column grid rendered first try (taffy grid
    through the cascade); hovered tile shows its gold border while
    others stay flat; one tap on "Major — all 12 keys" produced 12
    provenance-stamped cards in Rehearsal with the filmstrip
    overflowing (wheel-scroll receipt over the overflowing strip still
    to drive).
- 2026-07-05: **S4 slice 5 — Rehearsal tab: R1 material portability +
  the P5 filmstrip.** "+ Rehearse" on the Stage builds a Card from any
  lens (`StageState::card_from_lens`: scale/chord material, arpeggio
  touch, progression + exercise recipe provenance) into a
  `woodshedding::rehearsal::Set` that persists with the session. The
  Rehearsal tab is the redesign-P5 treatment: measured filmstrip (tag
  badge, label, touch, provenance; played cards dim behind the cursor
  via engine group opacity; current card ringed), transport deck
  (Prev/Next honoring LoopMode, Remove, count), the cursor card's
  material resolved on the big board. Host gains wheel scrolling
  (`scroll_at` + element-scroll carry across rebuilds). Driven
  receipt: four cards from four lenses, relaunch restored the set,
  Next-Next walked to 3/4 with cards 1-2 dimmed.
  - Pressure-cooker outcome: group opacity, outset box-shadow,
    border+radius cards, and overflow scroll all worked first try; no
    new engine bugs this slice. Host-side gaps noted instead: hover
    styling (engine has `apply_interaction` /
    `restyle_for_interaction` — the host never calls them), cursor
    shape changes, and CSS transitions (engine gap; dim/ring changes
    snap). Card-editor fidelity (Setting capo/window/voicing, Timing
    dwell auto-advance, per-card sound) deferred to the next
    Rehearsal slice.
- 2026-07-05: **S4 slice 4 — persistence (W0.2) + Settings tab + tab
  nav + all six themes.** `woodshed_core::storage` defines the seam
  (`Storage` trait + `PersistedSession`, serde with
  `#[serde(default)]` forward-compat and clamping restore) and the
  `Tab` enum; the desktop host persists to `genet-state.json` beside
  the xilem app's `state.json` (same ProjectDirs, distinct file — no
  clobbering during coexistence), saving after every dispatch and
  restoring at boot. Pills nav is real tab switching (Practice / Song
  / Rehearsal are honest placeholders). Settings ships the theme
  picker: all six seed sets (Slate, Ember, Light, Dusk, Meadow,
  Parchment) ported into `woodshed-views::theme::ThemeMode`, derived
  live through tinct, re-skinning on click (sheet regen + forced
  relayout). Driven receipt: Ember picked in Settings, app killed and
  relaunched — came back in Ember on the Settings tab with the pick
  highlighted. This is redesign P1 parity in the new stack.
- 2026-07-05: **S4 slice 3 — Exercise lens migrated; the lens strip is
  complete.** All generation lives in the theory crate
  (`Exercise::generate` over tuning + `ExerciseParams`); core adds the
  sequence-aware board (current step + fading trail of
  `EXERCISE_TRAIL` steps, newest-wins on collisions, fingering labels)
  and the four-fret hand-position nudge with clamping. The host beat
  clock now advances whichever step transport is playing. All five
  lenses resolve; the placeholder path is deleted. Driven receipt:
  Chromatic 1-2-3-4 running at step 7/48 with the trail exactly
  matching the generator (string-5 fingers 1-2 behind the current 3,
  string-6 finger 4 from the prior pass). Direction/trill params and
  per-step audio deferred with the S3 audio deepening.
  S4 remaining: Practice / Song / Rehearsal / Settings tabs,
  persistence (W0.2), redesign P4-P6.
- 2026-07-05: **S4 slice 2 — Progression lens migrated.** The theory
  crate already owned the hard part (`Progression::apply_in_key`
  materializes roman-numeral roles in the shared root's major key,
  matching woodshed-xilem); core adds `progression_board()` (cards +
  expanded chord's tones) and a ported `format_role` that now includes
  the degree-alteration prefix the old app dropped (♭VII renders as
  ♭VII). Views: catalog sidebar, chord-card strip (numeral in tertiary,
  concrete chord below, expanded card in `surface_hover`), chord-tone
  board, description caption. Cold start prompts until a pick. Driven
  receipt: I-IV-V in A → IV card expands → "showing D (IV)" with D-F#-A
  on the board. Deferred with the voicing work: per-chord voicing
  browser, overlay-all-voicings mode, per-chord hues.
  Cosmetic: dot labels clip slightly at 10px in 24px dots — take with
  the board polish pass.
- 2026-07-05: **S4 slice 1 — Arpeggio lens migrated.**
  `woodshed_core::arpeggio` ports the woodshed-xilem algorithm verbatim
  (bass-anchored CAGED shape generation, pitch-ascending run from the
  inversion's bass tone, up/down/ping-pong walk without turnaround
  repeats), unit-tested (shapes windowed, run ascends from bass, UpDown
  walk = 2n-2). StageState grows the arpeggio fields +
  `arpeggio_board()`; the view adds the deck (Run/Pause, Step, direction
  cycler, inversion cycler, shape ‹ n/m ›) and the step-dot highlight in
  `secondary`; the host advances the transport on the redraw chain at the
  transport bpm (still the W0.4 stand-in; the shared beat grid /
  metronome phase-lock from the old app is deferred with the sound-per-
  step voice). Driven receipt: Run at 120 bpm, step counter advancing
  (5/10 → 7/10 across 0.7 s) with the highlight walking the run;
  ping-pong turnaround verified against the walk math.
- 2026-07-05: **S3 spine done — engines through the W0.1 seam.**
  `woodshed_core::audio` defines the seam (`AudioBackend` trait +
  `TransportState`/`TunerState`/`TunerReading`, pure data);
  `woodshed-genet::audio::CpalBackend` realizes it over woodshed-audio's
  `SequencerEngine` (4/4 `Sound::click()` pattern) and
  `InputEngineBuilder::with_pitch`, degrading to an in-UI error string
  when devices are missing. Transport row (Play/Stop, ±5 bpm, Tuner
  toggle + readout) drives it; the host pushes state through the seam
  after every dispatch and polls tuner snapshots on a self-chaining
  redraw while listening (desktop's W0.4 stand-in).
  Driven receipt: Play → Stop at 130 bpm after two nudges, tuner
  listening with no reading in a quiet room (honest levels, no placebo).
  Audible click confirmed by Mark (2026-07-05) — sound-out through the
  seam is real end to end.
  Remaining for full S3/S4 parity, tracked for the screen migrations:
  chord/scale render playback, MIDI in/out, song engine, calibration,
  metronome patterns beyond straight quarters.
- 2026-07-05: **S2 done — dropdowns, lens strip, keyboard.** Root/tuning
  as xilem_serval `select` overlays in the header; lens strip (Scale /
  Chord / Arpeggio / Progression / Exercise) with Scales + Chords lenses
  resolving on the board (`positions_for_chord`) and the other three as
  S4 placeholders; Tab traversal + Enter activation through
  `focus_traverse` / `dispatch_key` with the `genet-winit-host` key
  mapping; incremental `apply` for attribute-only mutation batches.
  Driven receipts: Chord lens by mouse and by Tab-Tab-Enter, Root → C
  through the overlay ("C Major — 21 positions", C-E-G).
  - **Theming now rides `tinct`** (the pure OKLCH engine, repo dir
    `tincture`) — Slate seeds → `derive_palette` → CSS. The
    audio-widgets extraction question is closed; audio-widgets can
    itself migrate to tinct later if wanted.
  - **Genet engine fix #3, found by the dropdown:** hit-testing walked
    DOM order, so the open select overlay lost clicks to the in-flow
    sidebar behind it (clicks went *through* the popup). Fixed in
    genet-layout by lifting positioned subtrees over the whole in-flow
    hit walk, mirroring paint's plane split (two commits: sibling-level
    reorder `d15455130a1` proved insufficient for the cross-subtree
    shape; the deferred-queue lift `db0c9751d81` fixes it; regression
    tests for both shapes). Same approximation tier as paint: no z-index
    bucket sort, no negative-z.
  - Polish deferred: focus-ring styling (traversal is functional but
    invisible), select caret glyph, `Escape` closing an open list.
- 2026-07-05: **S1 done — Stage renders from live state and a click selects
  a scale** (screenshots: `woodshed-genet-s1-initial.png` /
  `-clicked.png`; synthetic click on "Major" moved the selection, the
  caption updated to "A Major — 47 positions", and the dots re-spelled to
  sharps from the theory crate).
  - New `woodshed-core` crate (the W1.1 split): `StageState` over
    `woodshedding` (tuning + root + scale, `dots()` via
    `Fretboard::positions_for_scale`), unit-tested. The plan's Shape gains
    this crate; the remaining lenses migrate into it during S4.
  - `woodshed-views`: `stage` module over live state (`clickable` sidebar
    mutating `StageState`) + `theme` module. Theme S1 carries the DERIVED
    Slate palette verbatim (probed from `audio-widgets`'
    `derive_palette`); porting the OKLCH engine to a pure crate (so
    Ember/user themes work without masonry) is an open follow-up — it
    touches the Strophe-shared `audio-widgets`, so it wants its own call.
  - Host: DPI-aware (`IncrementalLayout` at logical size,
    `rasterize_scaled` at physical), retained layout hit-testing, click
    dispatch through `GenetAppRunner::dispatch_click`. Layout is rebuilt
    per frame (fine at this scale); incremental `apply` lands with S2.
- 2026-07-05: **S0 done.** `woodshed-views` (demo Stage sheet ported from
  the smoke) + `woodshed-genet` (winit host on `genet-winit-host`'s
  `SurfaceHost`: rasterize → acquire → `compose_external_texture` →
  present). Genet/netrender consumed as git deps with the mere-pattern
  local `[patch]` overrides in the gitignored `.cargo/config.toml` (whose
  long-inert xilem-woodshed `paths` override was also fixed: it sat below
  a `[target]` header and parsed as a key of that table). Committed patch
  mirror: stylo/stylo_atoms (servo/stylo rev), taffy + ipc-channel via
  merely-made/genet. Verified by screenshot: window renders the sheet on
  Windows, colors matching the browser receipt.
  - **Finding: sRGB surfaces double-encode the genet scene.** vello
    writes display-referred bytes; `genet-winit-host::create_surface`
    preferred the sRGB backbuffer, which re-encodes and washes out every
    color. Fixed in genet (`40e5dd92760`, prefer non-srgb). Meerkat uses
    the same path and will darken to true colors on its next build.
  - Note: S0 lays out at physical pixels (no DPI scaling); wire
    `scale_factor` through `rasterize_scaled` during S1.
- 2026-07-04: Plan created. Decision locked: xilem_serval host, Dioxus
  recorded as the alternative. Prior receipts: cpal 0.18 bump (`aaa7cde`),
  genet browser render receipt (genet `2422044ad1a`), netrender wasm
  backend split (`6520d74ed`) + web-time (`83e4be37a`).


## App clipping audit (2026-09-07, first correction landed; follow-ups open)

The expanded Set exposed an app-side sizing conflict: the wide Stage body was
allowed to shrink to zero while the Set tray below it retained a large intrinsic
height. Only the body columns owned scrolling. Flowing narrow/medium Stage and
templates lacked an explicit page scroll owner. The graph's fixed native canvas
and absolute labels also lived in a shrinkable flex item, so narrow widths could
disagree about the canvas extent.

The bounded correction gives every Stage path vertical scrolling, keeps a
text-relative usable body floor with independent column scrolling, and lets the
Set increase page overflow. The fixed graph and overlays retain one extent;
a surrounding horizontal viewport handles narrow widths. These are product
layout responsibilities. Rehearsal, Looper, Tools, and Settings also lacked a
page-scroll owner; their `tab_content` branch now shares `.workspace-screen`.
The host already updates logical width and height on resize. Shared engine
clipping is not exonerated by this audit.

The responsive follow-through below addresses the Rehearsal viewport, Settings
navigation, and filmstrip overflow. Remaining audit work: shell construction in
`stage.rs` and shell geometry in `theme.rs` should be extracted together when
those contracts are stabilized; moving files alone does not repair sizing.

Done when measured host layouts preserve a usable board above the expanded Set,
scrolling reaches content below the window, and narrow graph scrolling keeps
paint and targets aligned. Presented desktop captures supplement host tests.


Validation: three real-host layout/scroll regressions pass. At 1500x664, the
wide board retains 224 logical pixels of height and the Set begins below it;
wheel scrolling reaches the Set bottom at y=648. At 420x664, the graph retains
its 520-pixel width and horizontal wheel scrolling moves its x origin from
28 to -146. At 1100x300, the Settings page scrolls to its bottom at y=284.
These tests use the shipping windowless host layout and wheel routing, not
CSS-string assertions. The first test run also exercised the 1100-pixel medium
layout; the final wide test explicitly asserts the 1180-pixel breakpoint.

All 51 view tests, the desktop build, and `scenarios/stage_clipping.scn` passed. Presented captures
in `Code/testing/woodshed/stage-clipping-20260907/run01/` show the fretboard
and Related pane above the expanded Set, and the collapsed-tray state. Actual
scroll routing is the host-test receipt; the native scenario records the initial
viewport and does not claim a native wheel injection. Artifact hashes and the
source commit are recorded in the parent `receipt.json`. Existing compiler
warnings remain. This bounded correction is not a whole-stack clipping pass.


### Responsive component follow-through (2026-09-07, landed)

The bounded refactor retains the page-scroll owners above. Rehearsal now wraps
its fixed-size board and labels in an orientation-aware viewport; the caption
stays outside that viewport. Settings' existing narrow stacking rule now applies
to the real page navigation, with wrapping items. Filmstrip cards retain their
width and declare horizontal overflow only. Luna implemented the components;
parent integration checked their ownership and added real-host regressions.

All five host layout/input tests and 51 view tests pass. At 420x700, Settings
opens through the workspace tab, navigation wraps within 388 pixels, and clicking
Instrument selects that page. At 420x900, Rehearsal keeps its 966-pixel board
inside a 364-pixel viewport; horizontal scrolling moves its origin by 240 pixels,
and clicking a visible note afterward marks exactly one position. These are
retained production-host measurements, not stylesheet assertions. The desktop
build passes with the existing unused-import/dead-code warnings.

The native scenario exposed a separate automation boundary: `genet-probe`
resolves selectors with an independent layout pass, while the host paints and
hits against retained layout. Settings selectors missed in the native receipt,
although the retained-host selector test passes. A bounded `pointer-click x y`
scenario verb allows a measured presented-frame point through the real host
pointer lifecycle. Sharing retained target geometry with the probe remains
follow-up work; the local helper does not fix that shared contract.

`scenarios/responsive_components.scn` passes at 700 logical pixels wide. The
presented Settings, selected Instrument page, and Rehearsal captures were visually
checked in `Code/testing/woodshed/responsive-components-20260907/run04/`.
The measured Settings click succeeds through native host routing; page selection
and Rehearsal entry use selectors. Earlier failed selector runs remain beside
the final receipt. Native captures show the initial viewport; the host tests
prove scrolling and note hits after scrolling. The parent `receipt.json` records
source and artifact hashes. Broader shell extraction and shared probe geometry
remain open; this is a bounded responsive pass.

### Retained selector geometry (2026-09-08, implemented; Windows verified)

The correction gives `genet-probe` an opt-in, authoritative host selector
target. Unsupported hosts retain the existing surface resolver; a participating
host's miss must remain a miss, including before layout exists. Woodshed consumes
`AppCtx::painted_rect`, already published in Mere `e02a08f1`, instead of asking
the probe to lay its DOM out again. The compatible Genet change is isolated
from concurrent engine work and based on Woodshed's existing pinned revision.

The done-conditions passed: shared protocol tests distinguish unsupported/hit/miss,
shape and recenter scenarios pass using semantic selectors, and native zoomed
and ordinary windows use the retained production pointer coordinate space.
Measured-point helpers remain available for diagnostics, with no claim that
this closes every clipping, occlusion, or offscreen scrolling case.

Dependency integration: Genet `09515e03d22` and Mere `691f9a0b` are consumed
from their published commits. Woodshed's lockfile contains one source revision
for each repository; its 37 changed package entries only move those pins. The
retained-selector implementation is integrated on Woodshed `main` in this
merge. The former `woodshed-retained-selectors` branch and PR #1 were the
handoff vehicle and are now historical references.

The recorded desktop receipt reports 406 focused tests: 8 host, 20 probe, 121
core, 10 examples, 14 graph, 56 view and 177 theory tests. The current merge
also passes the fresh locked core, graph and view suites (191 tests total) and
the locked `woodshed-genet` desktop build. Native `selected_shapes`,
`neck_comparison` and `anchored_pitch_motion` pass at requested 1100x900;
the latter uses UI zoom 0.65. `responsive_components` passes at 700x900.
Their actual captures are 2200x1504 and 1400x1504 respectively, at device
scale 2. Named Next/Previous shape, Hear, All tones, Recenter and Settings
controls replace measured click positions. Presented captures were inspected.

The unchanged `stage_clipping` scenario also passes at requested 1500x900
(actual capture 2464x1504). At requested width 1100, it still fails to leave
Set: the responsive layout stacks the panels and places the arrangement
control below the visible viewport. Its failure is retained beside the wide
pass. That is a viewport/scroll prerequisite for the M4 release lane to
address, not evidence of a Mac-only input failure. This slice does not add
automatic scroll-to-selector behavior or change `stage_clipping.scn`.

Source, binary, scenario and artifact hashes are recorded in
`Code/testing/woodshed/retained-selectors-20260908/receipt.json`. Native input
audio underrun/overrun messages occurred during these runs; they are not an
audio quality receipt. Cross-platform release, ancestor clipping/occlusion,
and the broader shell extraction remain open.
