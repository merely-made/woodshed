//! The startup persona pick (P1).
//!
//! A vault holding more than one persona, with nobody chosen, is the one case
//! where Woodshed cannot answer "whose practice is this?" on its own. It asks,
//! once, before the practice store opens — because opening it would mint a
//! `default` persona beside the two the user already has, and seal the session
//! to a stranger.
//!
//! The list itself is not woodshed's: [`persona_picker_focused`] renders the
//! roster the same way in every Merely application, so a persona reads the same
//! here as it does in Turnstone. What is woodshed's is where it appears (a gate screen in
//! place of the product root) and what happens next (`woodshed-genet` writes the
//! choice and reopens the store).
//!
//! **The gate is not a lock.** Escape practises with no persona at all: no key,
//! no store, nothing kept when the window closes. That is the same doctrine as
//! "sealing is not a gate" carried one step further — a tuner has to open on a
//! machine whose vault will not, and it has to open for somebody who does not
//! want to say who they are.
