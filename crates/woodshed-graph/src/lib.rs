//! woodshed-graph — woodshed's theory catalog as a chartulary graph.
//!
//! The first real consumer of the chartulary substrate (G3). It reads woodshed's
//! *existing* theory catalog (scales, chords, progressions, exercises) and relates
//! it as a content-addressed container graph, then demonstrates practice lineage
//! over stemma. No data is invented: the relations are read from or computed over
//! the real catalog.
//!
//! - **Nodes** are theory objects. Each is a [`Container`] whose id is
//!   `kind:name` (`chord:Major 7`, `scale:Major`), titled by its name and tagged
//!   with its kind and category.
//! - **Edges** are woodshed's own relation family (the app-private "inner ring",
//!   [`RelationClass::app`]):
//!   - a progression `Contains` a chord (read from the progression's roles), and
//!   - a chord `FitsInScale` a scale (computed: the chord's pitch classes are a
//!     subset of the scale's).
//!
//! Practice lineage lives in stemma, keyed by the same node ids: a practice
//! session is an `Owner` whose visits to theory objects branch and are recorded.
//! The spine does not auto-feed stemma; the consumer records visits with its own
//! "engagement" semantics, keyed by the shared identity. That is how the two
//! layers integrate (substrate plan open question 6, settled here: consumer-side).
