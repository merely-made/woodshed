//! Woodshed in a browser.
//!
//! The claim this crate exists to make good on is narrow and worth stating
//! exactly: the views here are `woodshed-views`, the same module the desktop
//! binary draws, rendered by the same Cambium and genet-layout and netrender,
//! onto a canvas instead of a window. Nothing about the interface is
//! reimplemented in JavaScript, and nothing about it is browser-specific.
//!
//! What differs from `woodshed-genet` is the event source and what boots:
//!
//! | | desktop | here |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | source | `cambium-genet-winit-host` | `cambium-genet-web-host` |
//! | entry | `run` owns the thread | `mount` returns, listeners keep it alive |
//! | state | `Shared::boot`: settings, MIDI, sealed store | none yet, see below |
//!
//! ## What this does not do yet
//!
//! It mounts the S0 Stage sheet, not the application. `Shared::boot` opens a
//! persona-sealed store, a MIDI host, and an audio backend, none of which have
//! browser realizations wired up: `woodshed-audio` is `cpal`, and the persona
//! vault is a filesystem. Those are separate pieces of work with their own
//! seams already in place (muniment ships an IndexedDB backend, and the audio
//! seam is where WebAudio goes).
//!
//! So this is a receipt for the rendering and input path, and it is honest
//! about being one. A reader will hear a canvas with a label and no structure;
//! see `cambium-genet-web-host`'s accessibility module for why that gap is
//! stated rather than stubbed.
//!
//! ## Building it
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo build -p woodshed-web --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
//! wasm-bindgen --target web --no-typescript --out-dir pkg \
//!     target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/woodshed_web.wasm
//! ```
//!
//! The page needs a `<canvas id="woodshed">` sized by CSS; the host reads that
//! box and sizes the backing store to physical pixels itself.
