//! The rehearsal card/set vocabulary — Woodshed's portable practice core.
//!
//! A [`Set`] is an ordered run of [`Card`]s you practice in sequence; a
//! card is one piece of [`Material`] with enough context to put it on the
//! neck and play it: where it sits (a [`Setting`]), how it's played (a
//! [`Touch`]), and how long to stay on it (a [`Timing`]). Said as a teacher
//! would: "take this card, the material is C minor pentatonic, in this
//! setting, with this touch, hold it eight bars."
//!
//! Everything here is pure, serializable data with no UI / audio / I/O
//! dependency, so the desktop app and any future CLI / web shell share one
//! persistable core. Selections resolve by *name* at the edge, so a catalog
//! edit between sessions can't scramble a saved set. Roots are stored as a
//! bare [`PitchClass`]; an app's spelled pitch-class type converts in and
//! out at the boundary.
