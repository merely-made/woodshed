//! Portable practice-engagement history, over chartulary's lineage model.
//!
//! **Adopted stemma 2026-07-26.** This was a hand-rolled event log until the
//! strength model came up and the investigation found woodshed already depended
//! on a better one: `chartulary::stemma` maintains per-subject
//! `first_seen_at_ms` / `last_seen_at_ms` / `visit_count`, and aggregates
//! per-pair traversals with their own recency — exactly the inputs a decayed,
//! recency-weighted strength model needs, and exactly what the local log did not
//! keep. Building the model on the local log first would have been the throwaway
//! path.
//!
//! The split follows the same line as the typed relations: **woodshed owns the
//! musical judgment, the substrate owns the structure.** Stemma holds the dated,
//! branching lineage; woodshed names the engagement kinds and decides what they
//! weigh. So the vocabulary here is unchanged and every consumer still speaks
//! [`PracticeHistory`] — only the store beneath it moved.
//!
//! Two deliberate mappings:
//!
//! - **The kind lives in the visit's `context`, not in stemma's
//!   `TransitionKind`.** Those variants answer "how did you get here"
//!   (`LinkClick`, `Back`, `Reload`) and map one-to-one onto a browsing trace;
//!   previewed / staged / completed answer "what did you do with it". Forcing
//!   one into the other would be a costume, so the app's own semantics ride the
//!   payload slot built for them.
//! - **Datedness rides the context too.** `visit_entry` takes a `u64`, not an
//!   `Option`, so an undated engagement (a host with no clock, or a session
//!   written before woodshed kept time) records `at_ms = 0` with
//!   `dated: false`. A reader must never read that as 1970.
