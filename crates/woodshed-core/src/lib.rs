//! Woodshed's portable state/logic core.
//!
//! Pure state over the `woodshedding` theory crate — no UI, no host, no
//! audio dependency, so the same core feeds the desktop host, the web host,
//! and tests. This is the genet-host plan's W1.1 split.
//!
//! S2 ships the Stage slice ([`StageState`]) with the lens model: tuning +
//! root + active lens, with the Scales and Chords lenses resolving to
//! fretboard dots. Arpeggios / Progressions / Exercises are placeholders
//! until their engines migrate from woodshed-xilem's `AppState` (S4).
