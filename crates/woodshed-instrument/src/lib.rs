//! Woodshed's seam to a Bluetooth-controlled smart instrument.
//!
//! The guitar this drives is its own amplifier, effects processor, looper and
//! metronome. Woodshed already owns every one of those concepts, so this crate
//! is not an adapter between strangers — it joins the same vocabulary across a
//! wire. [`ringdown`] speaks the protocol; this decides what Woodshed does
//! with it.
//!
//! # What this crate is careful about
//!
//! **Nothing is reported as fact until the instrument said it.** Every field of
//! [`InstrumentState`] is an [`Option`], and a `None` means *not read*, never
//! *zero*. A practice tool that displays a confident 0% battery for a guitar it
//! has not asked is worse than one that displays nothing.
//!
//! **The connection is always released.** The instrument serves one client at a
//! time, and a leaked connection does not merely waste a handle — it locks out
//! the next attempt, and the symptom is some later, unrelated request appearing
//! to fail. [`Connection::with`] exists so that the release cannot be
//! forgotten on an error path.
//!
//! **`ReadConfig` is never called.** It returns nothing and wedges the
//! instrument's RPC handler until the guitar is power-cycled. There is no
//! reason for Woodshed to reach it and a real cost to trying, so the refusal
//! lives in code rather than in a comment. See [`FORBIDDEN_METHODS`].
