//! The JSON-RPC layer: requests, responses, and the 32 methods.
//!
//! This is JSON-RPC 2.0 in shape, with one deviation that matters — see
//! [`JSONRPC_VERSION`]. Encoding a request produces a complete message ready to
//! hand to [`crate::llt`] for framing; decoding takes whatever arrived on the
//! response characteristic and sorts it into a result or an error.
//!
//! Nothing here does I/O or tracks a connection. Request ids are chosen by the
//! caller, because the caller is what owns the sequence.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Recovered by static analysis and **confirmed against a real instrument on
//! 2026-08-27**: `GetStatus` round-trips, and its reply is pinned as a test
//! fixture. See `design_docs/2026-08-27_ringdown_founding.md`, Findings F4,
//! F12, and H4.
